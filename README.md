Bringing an idea that has been ruminating in my mind for quite sometime. 
Combining my passion for data analysis and visualization, this is a project I am excited to build out.

The overall premise is using a calendar like interface and view and interact with financial transaction data instead of using spreadsheets.
Personally, I live in my Google Calendar. So, it is just a preferred interface to help visualize this type of data. Especially to overlap or group transactions by specific events such as conferences and networking events, trips, related to a specific project or gig, etc.

So the first thing is visualizing the different data sets in a calendar view. The next step is adding different features for more interactivity.
